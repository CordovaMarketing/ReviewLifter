      <p>Thereâ€™s this little known thing called Google My Business. Hardly anyone in the internet marketing world talks about it, but when you use it properly, you will notice a huge difference in your appointments booked.</p>
      <p>People generally accept that reviews are nice to have. Sure they keep you in good reputation. The truth is reviews are more important than you probably think.
      With even just a one star difference, you can be gaining 35% more customers than the next competitor behind you.</p>
      <p>Back in the day, people used to hop on the web. Now they live on the web. The tools and resources they use have adapted to offer more services. Google My Business offers more small business more ways to interact with your customers than your website. 
      All before the consumer even sees your website. Google my business is like a mini webpage with the most important information jammed on it. </p>
      <p>Soon enough, these nice features will not be as compelling to consumers. Video testimonials and audio ordering of products and services may take the lead. Everyone will have hundreds of reviews that just won't matter as much as they used to. 
      Are you going to miss this train? Start building your brand with authentic reviews and don't get behind the curve.</p>
      <p>Do you spend hours working on your social media presence, or pay thousands of dollars for an agency to do it with little to show for it? 
      Do you look at SEO as the behemoth it is and want to run and hide? You are justified in doing so. 
      The internet is out of control with more tools than you can bargain for. With ReviewLifter, you have to do one thing: 
      Send your customers invitations to leave reviews. They do the rest! </p>
